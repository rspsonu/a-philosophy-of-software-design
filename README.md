# Summary - A Philosophy of Software Design

## Why do we need a philosophy?

The start of a software project is the point where the software is at it's simplest form. The speed of development is also the fastest at this stage. We could say that the software is least complex at this point. But since software is an ever changing entity with modifications, new feature requirements, bug fixes, etc., its complexity will inevitably increase. 

A developer needs to keep in mind all the relevant factors when changing software, so as to implement the new requirement without introducing bugs. As complexity increases, the relevant factors that a developer needs to consider also increases, slowing down the rate of development and also introducing bugs, which slows down development even further.

To tackle this problem, we need to design software that is simple. The complexity would still accumulate inspite of our best efforts, but we can keep it from becoming overwhelming. This book aims to provide us with a philosophy that can guide us in designing simple software.
